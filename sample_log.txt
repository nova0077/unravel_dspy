Hi Praveenl, Hope you’re doing well.

I’m writing to express my strong interest in the Backend Engineering role at Unravel.tech. My experience building scalable, low-latency systems, as detailed in my resume, aligns perfectly with your company’s mission to be at the forefront of agentic AI and your commitment to technical depth and rapid experimentation.

Throughout my work at Helpshift, I’ve consistently focused on improving system reliability, handling real traffic at scale, and driving performance optimizations end-to-end. I’m particularly passionate about taking ownership of challenging problems and delivering robust, production-ready solutions. I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to Unravel’s innovative approach, especially given your use of DSPy.

I choose the 3rd rhyming word as Simplify because, it fits well with the quote
Apply the pattern,
DSPy the chain,
Simplify the logic.

Thanks,
Praveen
